## Overview of the Bacterial Biodiversity Dashboard

The Bacterial Biodiversity Dashboard is designed to facilitate interactive exploration of microbiome data collected from various volunteers. This digital tool aims to help researchers and curious individuals understand the microbial communities present in the human belly button and their potential implications on health and biology.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing complex datasets, enabling users to engage with the data through interactive charts and detailed metadata descriptions. By allowing users to select different samples from a dropdown menu, the dashboard dynamically displays corresponding data, offering insights into the microbial diversity within each sample.

### Functionality
- Sample Selection: Users can choose from a list of volunteer sample IDs to view specific microbial data.
- Bar Chart Visualization: Displays the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in the selected volunteer sample, providing a clear view of the predominant microbes in each sample.
- Bubble Chart Visualization: Each sample's microbial data is plotted in a bubble chart format where OTU IDs are represented along the x-axis, sample values (abundance) on the y-axis, and bubble size reflects the abundance of the microbes.
- Metadata Display: Accompanying each selected sample is a metadata panel that shows demographic and other pertinent information about the volunteer, which may provide context to the microbial data.

### Technical Stack
- D3.js: Used for creating interactive data visualizations.
- Plotly.js: Utilized for building detailed, interactive charts that enhance the user experience.
- JavaScript/HTML/CSS: Serve as the foundational technologies for building the web-based interface.

### Target Audience
This dashboard is intended for researchers, educators, students, and anyone interested in microbiology and data visualization. It aims to provide a comprehensive tool for exploring and understanding the role of microbes in human health.

### Project Impact
By making microbial data accessible and understandable, the Bacterial Biodiversity Dashboard serves as an educational tool that promotes awareness of microbial diversity. It also supports scientific research by providing a platform for data analysis and hypothesis generation regarding human microbiomes.
